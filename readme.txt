Project Proposal:

A web application generates recipe ideas based on a user's specified ingredients and dietary preferences, while also providing links to purchase the necessary ingredients from Walmart. Users can easily find the perfect recipe for their needs with additional filters for meal type, calorie count, price, and duration.
