Chill 1 hour before cooking or freeze on the sheet and transfer to a freezer bag for later cooking.\nRepeat process with remaining dough.\nTo cook, heat 1/2 tbsp of oil or a small amount of non-stick spray in a large skillet (or for a non-vegan version, cook some bacon until crisp and use the bacon fat). Add chilled gnocchi and cook, stirring once or twice, until well browned on all sides. Add desired sauce (don't add too much or they will fall apart) and toss well.",

Add corn, carrots, squash, broccoli, sea salt and black pepper. Cook on medium-low for 15 minutes, until vegetables are soft. Stir every few minutes so they dont brown. Add chopped parsley, stir and turn off heat. Let cool for 5 minutes. Empty veggies into a large glass bowl and gently mix in goat cheese until combined. Taste for salt and set aside.</li><li>Tomato Brodo: Set a medium pot on low heat. Add tomatoes, crushed garlic cloves, 1/2 cup of water, salt and pepper. Cook on low for about 30 minutes. Just before serving, strain broth into a bowl, leaving garlic and tomato seeds behind.</li><li>Ravioli: Add flour to a large mixing bowl. Make a well in the middle of flour. Crack eggs into the well. Using your fingers, gently break up the egg yolks as you incorporate the flour, little by little, into the egg mixture. When the dough has not yet come together, add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Continue mixing until the dough forms a mass. Test the consistency by poking your finger into the dough. If your finger emerges caked in dough, add a touch more flour.</li><li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for 8 minutes. It should feel super smooth when its ready.</li><li>Divide the dough into four equal parts. One by one, guide the dough through the pasta machine, starting at the widest setting, going down to the second-to-last notch.</li><li>You should now have four long sheets of past dough. Take about 1 1/2 tablespoons of veggie filling, and place it 2 inches from the edge of the dough. Repeat this all along the edge of the sheet, keeping the filling mounds about 2 inches away from each other. </li><li>Fold the sheet on top of itself, so the filling is now covered. Using a pizza-cutter (or ravioli-cutter if you have one), cut between the filling, creating individual ravioli. Trim the edges to create a straight edge. Repeat with the remaining three sheets of dough. If dough is not sticking together, gently brush edges with an egg wash.</li><li>Cook the ravioli in boiling water for about two minutes. Strain tomato broth and ladle into a bowl, and  top with ravioli. Garnish with fresh basil.</li></ol>",

If you want the gnocchi to look super nice, roll them on a fork to give them the characteristic stripes (I never do). Place the gnocchi in the fridge while you prepare the sauce.</li><li>Cut the savoy cabbage in stripes, wash it and stew it with a bit of water until wilted. Drain it and sautee it with 1 spoon butter and salt until cooked.</li><li>Prepare the cheese by dicing it and the rest of the butter by melting it with the sage and the garlic.</li><li>Cook the gnocchi in salted boiling water in batches. Throw 10-20 gnocchi in the pot of boiling water and fish them out once they start floating. Drain them and add them to a bowl. Dress with cheese, cabbage and butter and keep layering the ingredients in the bowl until you run out.</li><li>Do not mix the gnocchi in the bowl, as they are rather soft and would break. If the cheese didn't melt much, you can microwave the bowl for a couple of minutes.</li><li>Serve piping hot.</li></ol>",

Remove from the oven and let cool.\nCut the potatoes in half and scoop the flesh into a medium-sized bowl and mash until smooth. You can also use a potato ricer or food mill and rice. Let cool to room temperature.\nLine a large backing sheet with parchment paper. Add flour to the potatoes and mix.  Form a well in the middle of the mixture and add yolk, nutmeg and salt. Using a fork, stir until the potato mixture is evenly coated, it will not be completely smooth. Form the dough into a ball and divide into 4 equally-sized pieces.\nRoll each piece of dough between your hands and a lightly floured work surface into a 3/4 inch diameter rope. Cut the rope int 3/4-inch pieces and indent each piece with a fork. (The indent is optional, but will help the gnocchi hold the sauce.) Place the pieces on the parchment and repeat with the remaining dough.\nBring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil and add the gnocchi in batches. You don't want the water to stop boiling. It will sink to the bottom of the pot. Stirring occasionally, let the gnocchi cook until it floats and is cooked through, about 4 minutes. With a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked gnocchi to a bowl and set aside.\nIn a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and sautee until browned and most of the moisture has cooked off. Add the kale and continue to cook until it just begins to wilt, about 1 minute. Add milk and goat cheese and stir continuously until well blended. Add gnocchi and stir until coated and warmed through. Add salt and pepper to taste.",
